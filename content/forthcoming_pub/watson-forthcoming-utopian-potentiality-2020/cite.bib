 abstract = {We present the results of an investigation into the biographies, letters and archives of approximately 50 well-known figures in Western intellectual and artistic history in the post-Enlightenment era. In this article, biographies and partners of Virginia Woolf, Max Weber, Edna St. Vin-cent Millay, William Moulton Marston, Erwin Schrodinger, and Victor Hugo are mentioned. While some of these non-monogamous relationships are well-known, much of the evidence of their existence has been ignored, misrecognized, or intentionally obscured. The results of this survey demonstrate that contemporary patterns of non-monogamies are deeply rooted in historical precedence.},
