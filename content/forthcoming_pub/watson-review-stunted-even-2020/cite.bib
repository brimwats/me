 abstract = {A study of the recent addition of ‘asexuality’ to the Library of Congress Subject Headings. Drawing on historians of sexuality, feminist and asexual theory, and medical scholarship, I argue that this is a grave oversight. Throughout this essay, I also argue for the consideration of a new movement of critical catalogers (or #critlib).},
