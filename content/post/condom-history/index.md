Today, the strangely-elongated bell shape of a condom is instantly recognizable.
Condoms are the most-used sexual devices in the world, and in studies of
sexuality and sex practices the vast majority of people report being familiar
with condoms or have used one recently. The standard modern condom is made from
latex and is used to prevent pregancy (with 98% effacacy if used correctly) and
to act as a protection against most STDs. Polyurethane and lamb intestine
condoms also exist for people allergic to latex or looking for a different
experience, though the latter is not an effective barrier against STDs.

 

Unfortunately, we have not always been blessed with easily-accessible and
affordable condoms, and the history of condoms as a barrier device is a history
spotted with many strange inventions, failures, and, well, babies.

 

There are records of glans-style condoms (which just go over the head of the
penis) going back to the late third century BC, specifically one discovered at a
funeral site in what is now Turkey, made of gold and silver.

Additionally, there is some research to suggest that use of oiled paper, leather
or tortoiseshell condoms were common in China and Japan. But the real history of
condoms kicks off in the late 1400s when the French army invaded what is now
Italy and came face to face (or genitals to genitals) with the massive syphilis
epidemic that was just beginning to kick off there. The returning troops spread
the disease across Europe and it has haunted us since then (but is much more
treatable now).

The Italian anatomist and physician Gabriele Falloppio was the first to
undisputedly discuss condoms in his tract called *The French Sickness (1564)*,
which ended up being published two years after his death–likely for it’s frank
(heh) discussion of birth control and condoms. Falloppio’s condoms were made of
linen and tied onto the erect penis with a string. They would have looked like
these:

 

You can imagine how unfortunately these would have felt for both the wearer and
the person it was being used on. Regardless, Falloppio claimed that he had run
experiments on his rudimentary condom by having and patently-absurd number of
1100 Italian men fitted with the devices, instructed on their use and then
commanded to go out and Genesis 9:7 the earth. As he expected, none of them
caught the disease. While it is unlikely that Falloppio’s experiment would have
held up to modern scientific scrutiny, it did introduce the idea and use of
condoms to somewhat-general knowledge.

 

Either way, Falloppio’s condoms (can we call them floppy condoms?) made their
way across Europe and the English Channel at the very least, as they begin
appearing in the diaries of British libertines and rakes–they make various
appearances in Lord Rochester’s surviving records,and we begin to see quack
doctors selling condoms alongside herbal erection treatments. By the way, the
old tale about the name of the condom coming from a Dr. Condom providing them to
King Charles II to help the king avoid children is a legend–Charles should have
been trying harder for a heir, not avoiding it! English soldiers were known for
using condoms made out of sheep and lambs intestine, and there was a privy dig
that found examples going back to 1648.

 

Giacomo Casanova, by the way, discusses how strongly he dislikes condoms in his
diaries, where he referrs to them as ‘french letters,’ a common turn of phrase:

>   we set off to renew our voluptuous orgy. On the way he talked about modesty,
>   and said,—

>   “That feeling which prevents our shewing those parts which we have been
>   taught to cover from our childhood, may often proceed from virtue, but is
>   weaker than the force of education, as it cannot resist an attack when the
>   attacking party knows what he is about. I think the easiest way to vanquish
>   modesty is to ignore its presence, to turn it into ridicule, to carry it by
>   storm. Victory is certain. The hardihood of the assailer subdues the
>   assailed, who usually only wishes to be conquered, and nearly always thanks
>   you for your victory. . .

>   We found the three girls lightly clad and sitting on a large sopha, and we
>   sat down opposite to them. Pleasant talk and a thousand amorous kisses
>   occupied the half hour just before supper, and our combat did not begin till
>   we had eaten a delicious repast, washed down with plenty of champagne.

>   We were sure of not being interrupted by the maid and we put ourselves at
>   our ease, whilst our caresses became more lively and ardent. The syndic,
>   like a careful man, drew a packet of fine French letters from his pocket,
>   and delivered a long eulogium on this admirable preservative from an
>   accident which might give rise to a terrible and fruitless repentance. The
>   ladies knew them, and seemed to have no objection to the precaution; they
>   laughed heartily to see the shape these articles took when they were blown
>   out. [EPISODE 15 — WITH VOLTAIRE / CHAPTER XIX]

Boswell also documents his struggles with using a condom versus not with
prostitutes. In this one account he talks about feeling good about using them:

>   Tuesday 10 May 1763  
>   At the bottom of the Haymarket I picked up a strong, jolly young damsel, and
>   taking her under the arm I conducted her to Westminster Bridge, and then in
>   armour complete did I engage her upon this noble edifice. The whim of doing
>   it there with the Thames rolling below us amused me much.

But frequently for him he would forget or the prostitute would ask him not to
use them (because of how uncomfortable they were), and he would scold himself
for a week or more in his diary.

By the mid-to-late eighteenth century, however, condoms begin to become a
problem. Well, they become a problem for upper-and-middle-class religious
reformers. The focus now started to become on the use of the condom for
contraceptive rather than protective purposes. First the Catholic Church, and
then a number of Protestant figures, followed by secular doctors came out
against the use of condoms as contraceptives. Part of this hysteria was a new
emphasis on having sex over the perceived dangers of masturbation, the other
part of it was that moral reformers recoiled at the thought of working class men
and women purchasing condoms, which for years had been unaffordable to them (as
they could cost up to a week’s worth of pay). Prices began to sharply fall with
the introduction of rubber condoms by the 1850’s. These weren’t quite up to the
level of quality as we would expect, as they often had a long seam down the
middle that could cause chafing on the male member. They were also stiffer,
which meant less pleasure but more reusability.

 

By the 1860’s in England and by 1873 in the United States (with the passing of
the Comstock laws), the public campaign again condoms was in its full swing. In
the United States it was against the law to mail even information about condoms
through the federal mail system. And god forbid you mailed actual condoms–one
way or the other Anthony Comstock and his Law would (and did) come down
incredibly powerfully on the educators, manufacturers and distributors of
contraceptive devices — by the end of his reign he had destroyed hundreds of
thousands of these devices, and chased sexual reformers like Victoria Woodhull
out of the country and hounded others to death. It wouldn’t really be until
World War I where governments began to see the risk of STDs to their (young and
straight male) soldiers and embraced condoms as a prevenative device while at
the same time educating the recruits on the dangers of STDs.

 

In the United States, a Supreme Court decision in 1918 in favor of Margaret
Sanger (the founder of Planned Parenthood) allowed condoms to be distributed and
used by the general public, and by WWII anyone could get a condom from
newly-invented vending machines.The 1950s and 60s saw the availibility of
condoms increase when they were moved over the counters in stores and no longer
hidden. The last remaining state laws and regulations against condoms collapsed
in the face of the AIDS crisis of the 1980’s, and by the 90’s (only 20 years
ago!) you could finally purchase condoms just about anywhere and the stigma
against them was beginning to disappear.
