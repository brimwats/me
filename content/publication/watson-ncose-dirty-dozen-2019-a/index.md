abstract: "The National Center on Sexual Exploitation has included the American Library Association on their annual \"Dirty Dozen\" list of sexual exploitation enablers. You might be led to believe that the ALA was promoting open, free, and unfettered access to pornography—it’s not. Instead, NCOSE is targeting something alltogether different--the freedom of library patrons."
